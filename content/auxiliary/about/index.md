Taking the byte out of eight bits - what is that all about? At Triple E we believe that knowledge is to be shared in a manner that isn't overly complicated.

This site is all about sharing this knowledge freely, openly and in an easily-consumed manner.

Hopefully, it will inspire the young to pursue a career in STEM, or perhaps spark new love in technology for those of any age, profession or background.
